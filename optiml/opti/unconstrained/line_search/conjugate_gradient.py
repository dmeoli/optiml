class ConjugateGradient(LineSearchOptimizer):
    # Apply a Nonlinear Conjugated Gradient algorithm for the minimization of
    # the provided function f.
    #
    # Input:
    #
    # - x is either a [n x 1] real (column) vector denoting the input of
    #   f(), or [] (empty).
    #
    # Output:
    #
    # - v (real, scalar): if x == [] this is the best known lower bound on
    #   the unconstrained global optimum of f(); it can be -inf if either f()
    #   is not bounded below, or no such information is available. If x ~= []
    #   then v = f(x).
    #
    # - g (real, [n x 1] real vector): this also depends on x. if x == []
    #   this is the standard starting point from which the algorithm should
    #   start, otherwise it is the gradient of f() at x (or a subgradient if
    #   f() is not differentiable at x, which it should not be if you are
    #   applying the gradient method to it).
    #
    # The other [optional] input parameters are:
    #
    # - x (either [n x 1] real vector or [], default []): starting point.
    #   If x == [], the default starting point provided by f() is used.
    #
    # - wf (integer scalar, optional, default value 0): which of the Nonlinear
    #   Conjugated Gradient formulae to use. Possible values are:
    #   = fr: Fletcher-Reeves
    #   = pr: Polak-RibiÃ¨re
    #   = hs: Hestenes-Stiefel
    #   = dy: Dai-Yuan
    #
    # - r_start (integer scalar, optional, default value 0): if > 0, restarts
    #   (setting beta = 0) are performed every n * r_start iterations
    #
    # - eps (real scalar, optional, default value 1e-6): the accuracy in the
    #   stopping criterion: the algorithm is stopped when the norm of the
    #   gradient is less than or equal to eps. If a negative value is provided,
    #   this is used in a *relative* stopping criterion: the algorithm is
    #   stopped when the norm of the gradient is less than or equal to
    #   (- eps) * || norm of the first gradient ||.
    #
    # - max_f_eval (integer scalar, optional, default value 1000): the maximum
    #   number of function evaluations (hence, iterations will be not more than
    #   max_f_eval because at each iteration at least a function evaluation is
    #   performed, possibly more due to the line search).
    #
    # - m1 (real scalar, optional, default value 0.01): first parameter of the
    #   Armijo-Wolfe-type line search (sufficient decrease). Has to be in (0,1)
    #
    # - m2 (real scalar, optional, default value 0.9): typically the second
    #   parameter of the Armijo-Wolfe-type line search (strong curvature
    #   condition). It should to be in (0,1); if not, it is taken to mean that
    #   the simpler Backtracking line search should be used instead
    #
    # - a_start (real scalar, optional, default value 1): starting value of
    #   alpha in the line search (> 0)
    #
    # - tau (real scalar, optional, default value 0.9): scaling parameter for
    #   the line search. In the Armijo-Wolfe line search it is used in the
    #   first phase: if the derivative is not positive, then the step is
    #   divided by tau (which is < 1, hence it is increased). In the
    #   Backtracking line search, each time the step is multiplied by tau
    #   (hence it is decreased).
    #
    # - sfgrd (real scalar, optional, default value 0.01): safeguard parameter
    #   for the line search. to avoid numerical problems that can occur with
    #   the quadratic interpolation if the derivative at one endpoint is too
    #   large w.r.t. the one at the other (which leads to choosing a point
    #   extremely near to the other endpoint), a *safeguarded* version of
    #   interpolation is used whereby the new point is chosen in the interval
    #   [as * (1 + sfgrd), am * (1 - sfgrd)], being [as, am] the
    #   current interval, whatever quadratic interpolation says. If you
    #   experience problems with the line search taking too many iterations to
    #   converge at "nasty" points, try to increase this
    #
    # - m_inf (real scalar, optional, default value -inf): if the algorithm
    #   determines a value for f() <= m_inf this is taken as an indication that
    #   the problem is unbounded below and computation is stopped
    #   (a "finite -inf").
    #
    # - min_a (real scalar, optional, default value 1e-16): if the algorithm
    #   determines a step size value <= min_a, this is taken as an indication
    #   that something has gone wrong (the gradient is not a direction of
    #   descent, so maybe the function is not differentiable) and computation
    #   is stopped. It is legal to take min_a = 0, thereby in fact skipping this
    #   test.
    #
    # Output:
    #
    # - x ([n x 1] real column vector): the best solution found so far.
    #
    # - status (string): a string describing the status of the algorithm at
    #   termination
    #
    #   = 'optimal': the algorithm terminated having proven that x is a(n
    #     approximately) optimal solution, i.e., the norm of the gradient at x
    #     is less than the required threshold
    #
    #   = 'unbounded': the algorithm has determined an extremely large negative
    #     value for f() that is taken as an indication that the problem is
    #     unbounded below (a "finite -inf", see m_inf above)
    #
    #   = 'stopped': the algorithm terminated having exhausted the maximum
    #     number of iterations: x is the bast solution found so far, but not
    #     necessarily the optimal one
    #
    #   = 'error': the algorithm found a numerical error that prevents it from
    #     continuing optimization (see min_a above)
